                            <p> So as the title says, I stupidly updated a pirated copy of DaisyDisk. I deleted the app by moving it to trash and emptying it out. I then redownloaded an older version and tried to use a keygen but it still says "Illegal Key Detected" Is there some residual file i need to remove that is helping the app track the fact I'm using a pirated. I bought my first Mac, a 2018 13" MacBook Pro. I love it, but coming from a 1 TB HDD Windows machine to a 265 GB SSD, I can't help but constantly monitoring my drive space. And considering that it's normal for the 'System' and 'Other' to grow on its own, I looking to buy a disk cleaner to prevent that as much as possible. All costs aside, which one is objective the better app for disk management. Hey Everyone, got an email with a DaisyDisk discount. It's only valid for 48 hours though, NY2019TRIAL. Enjoy, it's saved me a bunch of space This started yesterday I was making a Minecraft time lapse video and I used quick time player to film. And I had about 40 or so minutes worth of footage and put it on Imovie and it kept saying my disk was full so I found a video on how to clean the cache on Mac. I followed the instructions and saved 50 GB. Than I saved another clip only about 20 minutes long and now it’s starting say my disc is full. I deleted a lot of files and pictures I don’t need, but all of that won’t I ran a DaisyDisk scan and I'm seeing that there's 15gb of "Hidden Space (https://imgur.com/a/IHhOYo2)" I'm wondering if that's a normal amount? As far as I know that's "system stuff" that shouldn't be tampered with but 15gb seems excessive. Does everyone have that amount. 
My system is taking up a whopping 58gb, I'd really like to know how I can minimise this. Any ideas? EDIT: Thanks a lot for the help guys, what I did to resolve the issue and get rid of quite a big chunk of this is that I went to the /Users/Username/Library/Application Support folder and found a lot of data and caches that were there from apps that I've even uninstalled months ago but hundreds of megabytes and in one case 27gb of their data was still there so I moved them to bin and deleted. I bought a new external SSD (SanDisk Extreme Portable 250GB) to store my sample library on it. I transferred a 37GB folder to it, and got warning messages that it was almost full. The Mac disk info dialog shows used space of 242GB, and DaisyDisk claims all of it is taken by the 37GB folder. What mistake have I made here, or what should I be checking? I never reformatted the drive so it's still exFAT. https://imgur.com/a/uZT4Dfg (https://imgur.com/a/uZT4Dfg). I have a 2014 Mac Book Pro. I frequently get the "disk space full" message and when I go to About This Mac, it says that of \~250 GB total, I only have 9.5 GB free and a whopping 136 GB is taken up by "Other". I've been trying to eliminate the common culprits (caches, application extra languages, old apps, etc), but when I look at my disk on DaisyDisk, it shows 100 GB being free and only 150 GB being used total. Any idea what could be causing the discrepancy/what the seemingly hidden "Other". I am a sysadmin at a company with a few Macs used by our creatives. They've got SSDs and I get tickets every now and then that they're out of space. The users are clearing their caches, but not everyone logs on all the time to do so, and I'm gun-shy about removing data from caches manually for After Effects, Red Giant, and other applications. Normally, what I have to do is SSH to the machine and log on as an administrator, sudo bash, and do du -h -d 1 for each folder, then iterate I just thought Hello, is there any alternative for DiskPie that would show the space taken by cydia packages? My system storage grew by 1gb all of a sudden and I would like to know if it was caused by some tweak I installed. 
Well, in my 256GB SSD space, 143GB is occupied by system. I thought they were time machine backups. But they are not. Anyone knows how to get the space back? Any suggestion welcome. Thanks. </p>
